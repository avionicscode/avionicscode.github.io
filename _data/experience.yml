    I was in the middle of doing my research when the world faced COVID-19 pandemic, and Iran suffered from a widespread of this virus as well.
    Among tireless efforts of different researchers about COVID-19, I was asked to join in a project about researching and developing tools over **CT images** that were used to diagnose involvement.
    This made a temporary change in accomplishing my main research.
    However, I had the opportunity to broaden my knowledge about medical images and use it to continue my research.

    The learning phase of the internship was about the parallelization techniques in computers.
    My focus was on **CPU parallelization** and learning of related libraries and techniques in C++.
    Also, I experienced a deeper understanding of compilers for improving performance.

    After the learning phase, my primary task was research on finding a high-speed solution for **Dynamic Skyline Problem** under the supervision of Dr.&nbsp;Saeid Gorgin.
    Along with acquired knowledge in parallelization, I employed my capability in developing algorithms and data structure in the MEMOCODE contest and we won the prize of this challenge.
