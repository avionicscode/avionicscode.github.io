  job_title: Ph.D. Researcher in Big Data Management
  dates: 2016 – 2023
  short_description: |
    Conducted advanced research in **Big Data**, focusing on **parallel skyline algorithms**, 
    **GPU acceleration**, and **decision support systems**.
  description: |
    As a Ph.D. researcher at the University of Blida 1, I worked independently on the design and 
    development of scalable algorithms for **continuous skyline queries over data streams**.  
    My research introduced **GPU-based acceleration strategies** that significantly improve real-time 
    analytics in various domains such as **IoT sensor networks, smart cities, e-commerce, and traffic monitoring**.  

    Key contributions:
    - Designed **parallel skyline algorithms** for high-dimensional data streams.  
    - Developed **GPU-powered frameworks** for real-time analytics and decision support.  
    - Published several **peer-reviewed papers** in Springer, IEEE, and MDPI Sensors.  
    - Applied algorithms to **smart homes, traffic optimization, intrusion detection, and recommendation systems**.  

    This work laid the foundation for **high-performance decision support systems** in heterogeneous computing environments.
