    My thesis explored the GANs usage in discrete sequence generation, especially text generation.
    I found some shortage in one of the common evaluation scenarios, and a new metric was introduced for enhancement of evaluation.
    Also, a new method supporting theoretical analysis was introduced which were comparable to the state of the art methods.

    The thesis (in Persian) and related publications are available in [*this repository*](https://github.com/IAmS4n/My-Msc-Thesis).
