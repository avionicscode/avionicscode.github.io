  My name is [*Ehsan*](https://www.pronouncenames.com/search?name=ehsan).
  I hold an M.S. in Artificial intelligence from the Sharif University of Technology.
  After graduation, I was working as a researcher in the Machine Learning Lab at the Sharif University of Technology.
  My research interest is **Machine Learning**, especially **Deep Learning**.
  My master thesis was about the **generative models** and usage of adversarial training for **sequence generation**.
  Recently, I have focused on **Computer Vision** with an application in **Gigapixel Histopathology** images.
  I also have some experience with multidisciplinary research, including the use of **GANs** in cosmology for Cosmic String simulations and segmentation and classification tasks for **3D images** of CT scan and MRI.
  
  I am fascinated by automation and the practical use of AI in real life.
  The application of theory for practical solutions is the most exciting part of the research for me.
  I enjoy dealing with challenges and solving problems, and I have participated in different competitions in the computer world, as you can see below.
