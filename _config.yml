  My name is [*Walid*](https://www.pronouncenames.com/search?name=walid).
  I hold a **Ph.D. in Big Data Management** from the **University of Blida 1, Algeria**.
  I have been working as an independent researcher, with a strong focus on **data management, parallel computing, and skyline query processing** in **big data and heterogeneous computing environments**.

  My research interests include **Big Data Analytics**, **Skyline Queries**, **Parallel and GPU-based Algorithms**, and their applications in areas such as **sensor data processing**, **traffic monitoring**, **intrusion detection systems**, and **intelligent recommendation systems**.

  My doctoral research centered on designing **efficient skyline algorithms** for large-scale and streaming data, emphasizing **GPU acceleration** and **time-based sliding windows**.
  I have also explored the use of **parallel frameworks** to enhance decision support systems in real-time environments.

  I am fascinated by automation, scalability, and the deployment of theoretical models into **practical, real-world applications**.
  I enjoy tackling complex challenges in data-intensive systems, and I have authored and published multiple single-author papers in international conferences and journals.
